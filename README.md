## Description

The Bolide Forex Software is an expert advisor (EA) that performs market analysis and executes trading operations based on profitable opportunities. It utilizes external parameters and global variables to customize its behavior and track trading statistics.

### External Parameters

1. MarketAnalysisPeriod: The period for market analysis.
2. OperationParameter: The default operation parameter.
3. EnableSecurity: Enable/disable security measures.

### Global Variables

1. AccountBalance: The current account balance.
2. TotalTrades: The total number of trades executed.

## Initialization

The `OnInit()` function initializes the expert advisor. It retrieves the initial account balance and prints it to the terminal.

## Deinitialization

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the expert advisor is removed or the terminal is closed. It calculates the profit/loss, profit percentage, and total trades executed during the EA's execution.

## Tick Function

The `OnTick()` function is called on each tick of the price. It implements the market analysis logic and checks for profitable trading opportunities. If a profitable opportunity is found, it performs the trading operations and increments the total trades executed.

## Profitable Trading Opportunities

The `IsProfitableOpportunity()` function checks for profitable trading opportunities based on the implemented market analysis logic. For demonstration purposes, it uses a placeholder condition where the market analysis period is greater than 10.

## Trading Operations

The `PerformTrading()` function executes the trading operations based on the specified operation parameter. For demonstration purposes, it uses placeholder code to determine the lot size and entry price. It then sends a trade request using the `OrderSend()` function and checks the result. If the trade request is successful, it prints the ticket number. Otherwise, it prints the error message.
